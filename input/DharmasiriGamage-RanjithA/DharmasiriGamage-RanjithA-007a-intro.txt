In a way, this was a new challenge to me. I think today it 
was a lesson of modesty that Mr. Gamage taught me.

New poets of the young blood began to mushroom 
under the guidence of Mr. Gamage. Today some of them have 
invaded the media. I wrote a personal letter to Mr. Gamage. 
pointing out that quantative development was not a true 
manifestation of qualitative development.To my surprise, the 
personal letter addressed to Mr. Gamage appeared in the next 
issue of the paper. Many responded. I well remember how 
Sujeewa Niranjanie Ratnayake attacked my position. Mr. Gamage 
in this manner displayed his transparency as a journalist.

To many of us he was "Gamage Sir". The two words 
"Gamage Sir" do not sense the fudal servitude to a teacher but 
smell the true fragrance of a father like teacher. That is why I think 
today he is a revolutionary who could not accomplish his vision 
but who was dedicated to his mission in the utmost sense of the 
word.

Sir, thy name is the shepherd. The shepherd who always 
looks out for the lost lamb.
